MusicMirror
##How to get started with React (windows, linux/mac steps may vary):

1. Install nodejs with sudo apt install nodejs (if that doesn't work, try to install npm or another package manager such as env, brew, n, nvm, etc.)
2. npm should come with nodejs but if it doesn't, install via your package manager.
3. Clone repo into your IDE
3. Checkout branch devsetup
4. Run git pull
5. Install React with npm install -g create-react-app
6. Go into musicmirror folder (cd musicmirror) and run npm start

You should be able to see something like this in your terminal 
> musicmirror@0.1.0 start
> react-scripts start

Give it a few minutes and you should have a new window opened in your browser and other text indicating React is starting with ***Compiled successfully*** text.
