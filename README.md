# MusicMirror

## How to get started with React (windows, linux/mac steps may vary):

1. Follow the answer in this [SO thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41524903/why-is-npm-install-really-slow) (There's a command in there that says 'nvm install 7' replace 7 with '--lts')
3. Clone repo into your IDE
3. Checkout branch devsetup
4. Run **git pull**
5. Install React with **npm install -g create-react-app**
6. Run **npm install**
7. Go into musicmirror folder (cd musicmirror) and run **npm start**

You should be able to see something like this in your terminal 
> musicmirror@0.1.0 start
> react-scripts start

Give it a few minutes and you should have a new window opened in your browser and other text indicating React is starting with ***Compiled successfully*** text.
